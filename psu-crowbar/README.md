# PSU Crowbar

The PSU Crowbar is designed to protect a radio from over voltage damage. This
can occur if the series pass transistor of your 13.8v high current linear power
supply goes short circuit.

Often the power supplies we use don't contain any internal crowbar and so have
killed radios in the past.
